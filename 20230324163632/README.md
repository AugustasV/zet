# GenAI Essentials Roadmap

* Understanding anomaly in prompts is very important, as it affects model behavior
* Before using AI, it's important to know its intended purpose and available modules
* HuggingFace is like GitHub for AI tools
* Having general knowledge about the tools rather than focusing solely on understanding concepts is best, due to frequent changes
* There are many free resources to learn GenAI
* There is no need to know how to fine-tune GenAI models if only using them for general purposes. Not everyone can do it
* Data should be consistent and of good quality
* Sometimes open source LLM data quality can be poor. For example, when 40% of data is scraped from social media - this is not good due to biases and other issues
