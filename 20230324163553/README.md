# Traceability, auditability, and security

When it comes to compliance in enterprises and companies, three fundamental principles are important:

1. **Four-eyes principle**: Have at least one other person review the deployed artifact. Is the person deploying the code different from the person who wrote it?

2. **Traceability**: Can we track where the released software comes from? Can we trace the requirements that led to the change through the code, build, and release?

3. **Auditability**: Can we see who, when, and why changes were made to the release process? Can we identify who, when, and why a new release was deployed?

In addition, security is crucial to ensure that individuals cannot perform unauthorized actions, including deleting evidence.
