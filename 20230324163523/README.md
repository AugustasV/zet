# Beginning in contributing open source

Explain ideas fairly
* Not every PR will be merged, good to create new issue.
* Submiting PR straight away is not a good idea, better to proof that 
Prepare draft proposal
* Show that you care about impacts
* You must convince the maintainers that your change is worth it.
* Be kind
* its possible that your change is not needed, so its getting rejected
* Good PR must have quality - readible code
* clean, testable, idiomatic code
* Is it contributing docs good start? Yes great way to start
* Proper open source projects have Contributors gidelines
* Check for first good issues tag
* Big open source projects could accept PR, do research about it.
