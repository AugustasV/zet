## Kickstarter for Sonatype PC keyboard

* Sonatype keyboard made differently so you could write faster. 
* It works simillary like old-school T9 typing where you could type kinda random letters, simillar ones to real words and it would automatically arrange letters in correct order.

### Senotypes
* Sonatype keyboard works differently, because you typing syllables rather than letters. 
* That's why that kind of typing could use full potential of writing speed - 1,200 or 225 words per minute.
