# Discipline, Pomodoro timer

* Discipline is super important part of life, whoever heeds discipline shows the way to life, but whoever ignores correction leads others astray.

* One of the best apps to stop mindless surfing I found is [Leechblock](https://github.com/proginosko/LeechBlockNG), it allows different settings, different times and modes. It's possible to put a password, so you couldn't correct the settings, limit time per page, even blur a page. Proper [documentation](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/faq/)
Override function in some serious cases.

* For Habits tracking using Trello board with those Power-ups:
    * Calendar Repeater
    * Card Priority by Screenful
    * Calendar Power-Up
    * Card Aging
    * Streak - habit tracker
    * Card Delete
    * Deadlines by Elegant
    * ufile.io

* As pomodoro timer used to use [Pomello](https://pomelloapp.com) because it's synced with trello tasks.
* [Workrave](https://github.com/rcaelers/workrave) is pretty good to make breaks between work, probably will try to use as Pomodoro timer as well. Have pretty good statistics, open source as well. The minus is that automatically loosing statistics per different task.
