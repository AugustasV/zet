# Role of an Architect

To excel in an Architect role, it is essential to possess a combination of strong technical and soft skills. Here are some key considerations:

1. Continuous Learning: Junior or Mid-level developers can be valuable sources of knowledge about new technologies as they often have more time dedicated to learning.

2. Effective Listening: Rather than striving to be the smartest person in the project, architects should prioritize active listening and understanding the perspectives of others before sharing their own insights.

3. Architect Certification: Obtaining an Architect certification can be beneficial for validating one's expertise and demonstrating a commitment to professional development.

4. SLI and SLO: Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are typically defined by the customer, outlining the desired performance metrics for a particular service or system.
