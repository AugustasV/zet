# Hands-on Crossplane workshop overview

Crossplane, a groundbreaking deployment platform, provides an alternative to traditional tools like Helm. By standardizing API interactions across cloud providers, Crossplane eliminates the need for specific platforms and ensures a consistent experience through its Cloud Resource CRDs. It offers the flexibility to deploy diverse resources with different credentials within a single cloud environment. While Crossplane simplifies infrastructure composition, it faces challenges in terms of visibility, stability, and seamless upgrades. For developers working on large projects with specific requirements, alternative solutions like Terraform may be more suitable. Nevertheless, Crossplane remains an intriguing technology, revolutionizing cloud computing with its standardized approach and potential to abstract away from cloud providers.
