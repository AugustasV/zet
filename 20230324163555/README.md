# Canary Deployment

Canary deployment involves releasing new features to a subset of users before a wider release.
  
* Inspired by canary birds used to detect dangerous gases in coal mines.
* A small percentage of traffic is redirected to the new feature for testing and user feedback.
* Dark launching is when users are unaware of the new feature as deployment only to backend.
* Deployed in both backend and frontend to assess user responses.
