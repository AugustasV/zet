# How to install hard to fit/stubborn tire on rim

I didn't have any tools with me to change inner tube on my road bike, and was thinking how to fit properly. The key idea is to wiggle tire and tube around to fit properly into wheel grooves. No extra tools are required, and pretty fast to do it + you minimize possibility to puncture your tire while installing.
