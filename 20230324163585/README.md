# Open-source terraform - OpenTofu

* Industry leaders are not well known - Gruntworks maybe, for Terragrunt. Others just random one, Foundations is a joke.
* Probably it will be native in Kubernetes - because it's CNCF project now
* Because many people and companies will contribute, it could mean many people and many opinions
* Terraform is not the only tool in the market, cloud providers one of those, or Pulumi. If it would suck to rewrite? Yes but it could be done
* OpenTofu has not simpathy to Terraform, kinda letting die after so much work, same thing as happend with Harness and Jenkins
* It's all about companies fighting other companies
* If company is not paid to manage terraform - than it's not affected by that.
* BSL basically the anti-AWS license
