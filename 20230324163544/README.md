# üó£Ô∏è Where does platform start and end? 

* Platform Engineering is the practice of building and maintaining a technology platform that meets customer needs and enables efficient operations.
* Managing platforms through Jira can be clunky, slow, and prone to errors.
* While Kubernetes provides a powerful and consistent API, it was not originally designed for platform management.
* A successful platform should understand customer needs and be regularly updated to align with team requirements.
* Team APIs should encompass code, documentation, and user experience considerations.
* Continuous team interactions, awareness, and learning are essential for effective platform engineering.
