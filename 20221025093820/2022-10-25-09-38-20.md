# Conway law
* Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.
* one way is to put into monorepo, easiest approach but not scalable, and it could be messy
* service centric approach would be new repo with infra code
* other teams shouldn't be able to edit infra
