## Compliance Challenges and Solutions

- Continuously assessing and maintaining compliance across cloud environments is a major challenge[1]
- AWS provides tools like AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Audit Manager to help manage compliance[1]

## AWS Config for Compliance

- AWS Config continuously tracks resource configurations and changes[1]
- It allows creating rules to evaluate compliance of resource configurations against desired settings[1]
- Automated remediation of non-compliant resources is possible using AWS Config rules and AWS Systems Manager[5]

## AWS CloudTrail for Auditing

- CloudTrail provides a log of all API activity across AWS accounts and services[1]
- Logs can be analyzed to audit actions taken and identify potential security risks or compliance violations[1]

## AWS Audit Manager

- Audit Manager helps automate evidence collection for audits of AWS usage[1]
- It continuously collects and evaluates audit evidence from AWS services like Config and CloudTrail[1]
- Audit Manager provides a centralized dashboard to review audit preparedness and findings[1]

## Compliance Best Practices

- Leverage managed rules and security standards from AWS Security Hub[5]
- Implement preventative guardrails using AWS Config rules and service control policies[1][5]
- Automate remediation of non-compliant resources with Systems Manager Automation documents[5]
