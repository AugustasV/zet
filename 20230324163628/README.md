# AWS Bedrock

* Limitations with Telegram about updating pools every 24 hours
* Bedrock angels help with automations, reasoning, as smart assistants
* Cost depends how heavily you would use, price per tokens (how many words, long )
* For now AWS Bedrock could only triggered from lambda function ( maybe for a moment) 
* Data was imputted from console for now.
