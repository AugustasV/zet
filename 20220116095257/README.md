# Key value databases
There is no better or worse database type, MySQL or NoSQL.
It totally depends on data you want to work with.

* NoSQL data structure.
* One of most simple one, Redis
* Limited storage, can't be used as main database.
* Unlimited scalability horizontally and vertically (NoSQL pluses)
