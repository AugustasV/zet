# Observability

* Automated observability. It must be measurable
* Sometimes problems are tackled, you have to use system to detect those
* After issue, It's good to write post motern as postmortem brings people together to discuss the details of an incident: why it happened, its impact, what actions were taken to mitigate it and resolve it, and what should be done to prevent it from happening again.
* Dynatrace tool for huge scaling, so services mapping would be useful, to see visually (dynatrace smartscase) 
Settelite services helps to decide what metrics to monitor
