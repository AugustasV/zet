# Budget friendly cloud providers

To test things out on cloud, it's good to know where to get best price/quality ratio. Those are situations than I want to test Kubernetes clusters with multiple nodes, load balancer.

* Hetzner 
I was disappointed by this cloud provider because of authentication process, I had contact support for verification, but didn't get any answer for about 20 hours. Have terraform provider.

* Vultr
Quick registration, had to top up my account min 5 eur via debit card. I was ready to create virtual machines instantly after registration. Have their own terraform provider.

* Digital Ocean
Pretty smooth, good support.
