# Budget friendly cloud providers

I was looking for budget-friendly cloud providers to test Kubernetes cluster with multiple nodes and load balancers, with best price/quality ration. After some research, find out those key players in the market right now.

* Hetzner 
Affordable EU provider, GDPR-compliant, with data centers in Germany, Finland, and the USA. Verification may take time.

* Vultr
Quick registration, low minimum top-up, and a Terraform provider for easy VM creation. Verification was done instantly.

* Digital Ocean
Smooth experience, good support, and ideal for Kubernetes clusters and load balancers.
