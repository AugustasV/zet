# Raspberry Pi OS - DietPi

Decided to spin it up Raspberry Pi Zero W - model with wifi. Installed DietPi
which is lightweight and more polished Raspbian version. Before first boot
inserted wifi details into `/boot/diepti-wifi.txt` so it was automatically
connected to internet
Installed gogs, mariadb, bluetooth. Only 114 mb of ram used.
