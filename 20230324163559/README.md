# API design principles

The principles of “functionality”, “usability”, and “experience” state that a good design must not only have a purpose, but should be easily leveraged and address the human experience.

Functional
* Keep in mind if API helps to access needed data, will be ready to use and could connect to system.
Usability
* How quick I could start to use it
* Is API is complicated to understand?
* It is maintainable?
