summary:
  ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! The KEG community welcomes you. This is an initial
  sample `keg` file.
  
  * This is where I dump my knowledge as it happens, all my zettels ("slips" or notes) about almost anything and everything. 
  * The idea is rather simple and very powerful. 
  
  If you are a `vim` user you might want to add something like the
  following to your `.vimrc`:
  
    au bufnewfile,bufRead keg set ft=yaml
