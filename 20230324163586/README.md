# Monitoring Grafana and InfluxDB lab

* Grafana used to show dashboards from different metrics that came from different places
* Telegraf plugin  collects data from various sources using specialized plugins, then sends this data to InfluxDB.
* InfluxDB stores the data neatly in a way that makes it easy to use and analyze later.
* Using influxdb datasource we can show metrics in Grafana dashboards.
