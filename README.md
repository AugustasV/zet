# zet
Zettelkasten Repo. This is where I dump my knowledge as it happens, all my zettels ("slips" or notes) about almost anything and everything. The idea is rather simple really and very powerful. 
## Index of zettels
You could access all zettels via website url: [https://augustasv.github.io/zet](https://augustasv.github.io/zet)

GitHub's action generates index file once a day.
