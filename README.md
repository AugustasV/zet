# Zettelkasten Repo
This is where I dump my knowledge as it happens, all my zettels ("slips" or notes) about almost anything and everything. The idea is rather simple and very powerful. 

## Index of zettels
You can access all zettels via this website URL: [https://augustasv.github.io/zet](https://augustasv.github.io/zet). GitHub's action generates an index file on every commit.
