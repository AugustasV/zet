  - Updating 60 VMs with MySQL took approximately 1 month, involving 3 engineers and causing partial downtime for 14 hours.
- **RDS Update Scenario:**
  - Updating 300 RDS instances took 1 day, required 2 engineers for PR review, and led to only 6 minutes and 50 seconds of partial downtime.
- Utilizing DB replication and GCP services resulted in significant savings.

**Secrets Management:**
- Secrets management is a crucial aspect of the architecture.
