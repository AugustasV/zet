# DevContainer Image for Local/GitHub Codespaces Development

## GitHub Codespaces
To utilize this image with GitHub Codespaces, simply run the repository, and it should function correctly.

## Local Development Using Visual Studio Code

For local development with Visual Studio Code, please refer to the [official tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial). You will need to have the DevContainer extension installed.

## Local development using open-source tool devpod
DevPod reuses the open DevContainer standard (used by Github Codespaces and VSCode DevContainers) to create a consistent developer experience no matter what backend you want to use. [DevPod Github](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod)
