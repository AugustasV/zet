# Why follow others to do labs
* If you see no sense just following some labs with other instructor, think twice.
* If you want to do sports, friends will show you how to do stuff, than you will
start to understand abit, and you could do it yourself.
* Same by doing labs, at beginning thing will not make sense, but later on you
could tackle labs without any support. Labs show where to dig into documentation.
